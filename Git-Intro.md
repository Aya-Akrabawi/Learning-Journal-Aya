## Git Tutorial: Part 1:

**Git** is Aa free and open source DVCS (distributed version control system) that has snapshot feature that when you make any changes on you project version and commit it, Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

**what can Git do?**+
1. Snapshots
as we mentioned in the definition.

2. Local Operations:
that is the project’s history resides on the local disk, which allows fors process expediency. 

3. Tracking Changes: Git tracks every single change applied to any file or directory and detect file corruptiom or loss of information in transit.

4. Loss of Data: with Git, your suffering from irreversible damage to files will be decrease as Git set up to minimize that.

5. States: Files in Git can stay in three main states:
    - Committed: Data is securely stored in a local database
    - Modified: File has been changed but not committed to the database.
    - Stage: Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
