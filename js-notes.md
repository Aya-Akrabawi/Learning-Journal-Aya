1- *ACCESS CONTENT 2- *MODIFY CONTENT 3- *PROGRAM RULES  4- *REACT TO EVENTS 
*A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
*To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
* Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps:
1: DEFINE THE GOAL 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT (by flowchart) 3: CODE EACH STEP
