# Growth Mindset:
**Today, our coach  talked about growth mindset, the opposite of fixed mindset, so what do we mean by it?
Growth Mindset, simply is when someoene understand that their abilities can be developed, by practicing and give their efforts.**

And as  Albert Einstein said about growth mindset: :shipit:  :speech_balloon:
> It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer. –

  So let's say bye to  ~~FIXED~~ mindset and welcome _**GROWTH**_ by keeping in our minds:
  - do not give up when you spend alot of time trying something, because this is the effort which will let you success.
  - accept the Criticism and learn from it.
  - read the storys of others succeful and get the inspiration from them.
  
 This is growth mindset from my perspective as an industrial engineer who's lerning programming and share my files at [My GetHub link](https://github.com/Aya-Akrabawi)
